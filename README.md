**This is a one page portfolio made with a SkeletonCSS boilerplate.**

I wanted to make a quick portfolio with the responsive CSS boilerplate from Skeleton. Using the boilerplate was quick, easy, and painless. You don't have to install anything. I just downloaded the files and went to work. I think this is something that I will use to make quick and simple HTML/CSS projects in the future.

_Technology used:_
[SkeletonCSS](http://getskeleton.com/) for the responsive web design.
[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the icons.
[UIGradients](https://uigradients.com) for the background.
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) for the web IDE.
